                    question: "What technologies are used in this project?",
                    answer: "The frontend is built with <strong>React</strong> and styled with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. The backend is a <strong>Node.js</strong> server using the <strong>Express</strong> framework. All data and user authentication are handled by <strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Firestore Database and Authentication)."

                    question: "How is the styling (CSS) handled?",
                    answer: "We use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing custom CSS files for each component, we apply utility classes directly in the JSX (e.g., `className='bg-blue-500 text-white'`). The only CSS file is `src/index.css`, which loads the Tailwind library."

                    answer: "On the Login page, click the 'Forgot Password?' link. Enter your registered email address, and if an account exists with that email, Firebase will send you a secure link to reset your password. Note: This will not work for accounts created using Google sign-in."

                    answer: "On the home page, use the main search bar to enter your 'From' and 'To' locations. As you type, a list of suggestions will appear. Once you have selected both locations, click 'Search Flights' to see the results."

                    question: "How does the seat selection work?",
